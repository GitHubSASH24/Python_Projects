Summary of Model Enhancements:
1. Added Features:
   - Transaction_Frequency: Counts the number of transactions made by an account.
   - Transaction_Time_Deviation: Measures the deviation of transaction times from noon (business hours).
2. Adjusted Classifier Parameters:
   - max_depth: Set to 6 to limit the depth of the decision tree, reducing overfitting.
   - min_samples_split: Increased to 8 to require a larger number of samples before splitting.
3. Impact:
   - Improved precision and recall for fraud detection by better capturing patterns in fraudulent behavior.
   - Enhanced interpretability and reduced overfitting through parameter tuning.
